# Scientific Keyphrase Extractor üîëüî¨

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://skeforu.streamlit.app/)

A powerful web application built with Streamlit that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze scientific documents (`.pdf` and `.docx`) and extract the most relevant keyphrases. It features a secure user authentication system and presents the results through a suite of stunning, interactive visualizations.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* üîê **Secure User Authentication**: A complete registration and login system with password hashing (`PBKDF2HMAC`) and salting to protect user data.
* üìÅ **Multi-Format Document Support**: Seamlessly upload and process both `.pdf` and `.docx` files.
* üß† **Advanced NLP Core**: Utilizes the **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm to intelligently identify, score, and rank the most significant phrases (from unigrams to trigrams).
* üìä **Rich Interactive Visualizations**:
    * **Word Cloud**: A dynamic visual representation of keyphrase prominence.
    * **Donut Chart**: Understand the proportional importance of each keyphrase at a glance.
    * **Radial Bar Chart**: A unique and beautiful chart mapping keyphrase frequency and importance.
    * **Frequency Histogram**: A classic bar chart for easily comparing term frequencies.
* üéõÔ∏è **Customizable Analysis**: An intuitive slider allows you to select the exact number of top keyphrases you want to analyze.
* üìú **Persistent Activity History**: Your past analyses are saved to your account. You can revisit any previous document's keyphrases and visualizations at any time.
